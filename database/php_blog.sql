(1, 'Impact of guidance counseling on students-teachers&rsquo; performance', 'Guidance counsellors provide a unique set of services that even the most dedicated teachers cannot fully replicate due to their primary focus on academics and the need to reduce the time and energy spent on classroom management. Counsellors actively contribute to team building, staff morale, and the sense of community by cooperating with teachers, parents, and other school staff to prioritize student well-being. They provide consultation on classroom management, behaviour interventions, and student support strategies. This support fosters a positive school climate, increases learning gains, and improves students&rsquo; overall well-being.\r\n\r\nThere is increased awareness of how mental health issues may negatively impact the education outcomes of children and adolescents. Counsellors conduct in-depth assessments of students&rsquo; social, emotional, and academic needs. This holistic view allows them to identify underlying issues impacting a student&rsquo;s learning or behaviour.\r\n\r\nIndeed, establishing a guidance office follows the recognition of the responsibility to help students navigate social and emotional challenges such as anxiety, depression, grief, and relationship issues. Counsellors are trained to respond effectively to crises, such as bullying, violence, or trauma. They provide immediate assistance to affected students and staff, helping to minimize the impact of such events.\r\n\r\nMoreover, counsellors play a vital role in assisting students with career exploration, college applications, and financial aid processes. This, in turn, cultivates the deeper habit of ensuring decision-making is as informed as possible. Guidance counsellors are often the best source of information for students related to potential career paths, providing strategic advice for bridging interests and opportunities.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a good guidance counsellor generates value-added outcomes to a school&rsquo;s curriculum by assisting in developing and supporting students&rsquo; soft skills. Through individual counseling sessions, group activities, and workshops, counsellors can help students cultivate essential skills such as communication, critical thinking, problem-solving, teamwork, and leadership. Through their interventions, guidance counsellors empower students with the essential soft skills necessary for success in both academic and professional settings.\r\n\r\nFor example, counsellors can facilitate group discussions and role-playing exercises to improve communication and interpersonal skills. They can guide students through problem-solving activities, teaching them to analyze situations, identify potential solutions, and evaluate outcomes. Also, by encouraging student participation in extracurricular activities and community service, counsellors provide opportunities for students to develop teamwork, leadership, and responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe importance of guidance counsellors is often overlooked by schools due to a variety of factors, including budget constraints, a lack of understanding of their role, and a focus on academic achievement. Budget constraints can limit the number of guidance counsellors available, leading to large caseloads and less individualized attention for students.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, some administrators and teachers may not fully understand the role of guidance counsellors, viewing them as primarily responsible for discipline or college counseling. This lack of understanding can lead to the underutilization of guidance services and a failure to recognize their broader impact on student well-being and academic success. Finally, a strong emphasis on standardized test scores and academic performance can overshadow the importance of social-emotional development and mental health, which are areas where guidance counsellors play a vital role.\r\n\r\nIntegrating guidance counseling into an educational institution requires a collaborative approach involving counsellors, teachers, and administrators. Regular communication and joint planning can ensure that guidance services align with the overall educational goals of the institution. Teachers can play a crucial role in identifying students who may benefit from counseling services, while administrators can provide the necessary support and resources.\r\n\r\nBuilding strong relationships with students is essential for effective guidance counseling. Counsellors can achieve this by regularly interacting with students, participating in school activities, and creating a welcoming and approachable environment. Student awareness of available guidance services is crucial. Schools can promote guidance services through assemblies, classroom presentations, and school announcements or newsletters.\r\n\r\nMainstreaming the guidance role involves integrating the relevant principles and strategies into the overall school culture. This can be achieved by incorporating guidance concepts into classroom instruction, promoting social-emotional learning, and creating a positive and supportive school climate.\r\n\r\nAn effective guidance counselor&rsquo;s office should be centrally located, easily accessible, and private to maintain confidentiality. The space should be large enough for individual and group counselling, with a flexible layout and comfortable furniture. Creating a welcoming atmosphere involves using calming colors, incorporating inspiring decorations, and adding plants. The office should also house a well-stocked library, online resources, and referral contacts.\r\n\r\nConfidentiality and privacy are paramount, with designated private spaces for counseling sessions and clear communication of confidentiality policies.\r\n\r\nEthics aside, from the perspective of a cost-benefit analysis, school administrators should see hiring guidance counsellors as the smart choice. Counsellors free up teachers to focus on their core responsibilities of instruction and classroom management. This enhanced efficiency can lead to improved student outcomes and a more positive learning environment. By proactively addressing student needs guidance counsellors can help prevent more serious issues that could require costly interventions.\r\n\r\nGood guidance furthers a holistic approach to education, taking into account its social, emotional, and career-related dimensions in addition to its academic aspects. Counselling is essential for creating a supportive and nurturing learning environment that fosters both short-term success and long-term growth beyond the classroom. By augmenting collaboration, building relationships, and mainstreaming the guidance role, educational institutions can create the comprehensive system of support needed to engender a community of content, confident, and capable graduates.', '173484572494667.jpg', '2024-12-21 13:06:38', 6, 3, 0),
(2, '&lsquo;Tomorrow and I&rsquo; gives unique prediction about dystopian future', 'Hollywood has so far offered countless images of what the future, defined by highly advanced AI and robotic technology, looks like in the West, but how about the East, particularly Southeast Asia, where cultural and philosophical views are very different from the rest of the world? The answer may be found in the latest Netflix series, Tomorrow and I.\r\n\r\nFrom a quick glance, the four-episode miniseries from Thailand looks like a Black Mirror rip-off. Yet, Tomorrow and I is actually a very fresh concept. With famous Paween Purijitpanya in its director&rsquo;s chair, it examines a dystopian future in Thailand, where tensions are caused by modern technology and moral dilemmas created by the conflicts with conservative perspectives.\r\n\r\nIn the first episode, Black Sheep, the husband of a Thai female astronaut, tries to bring his wife back to life through cloning after her life was cut short in a cosmic accident. The outcome turns out to be very different from what he expected.\r\n\r\nThe x-rated Paradistopia episode deals with the issues of deviant sexuality when a female tech entrepreneur wants to introduce robots into Thai society to replace the actual sex workers. The CEO&rsquo;s original intention is to overcome a past trauma.\r\n\r\nThe episode Buddha Data takes place three years from now, in a time where traditional Buddhist belief collides with new AI-powered devices that give users merit points that they can use for their own good now rather than wait for the afterlife.\r\n\r\nThe final episode, Octopus Girl, takes viewers to a possible future where it is raining non-stop and follows two girls in a slum community. The two friends, along with the rest of the people in the district, are now living in fear as their home is not at risk of submergence.\r\n\r\nThe series offers an in-depth blend of sci-fi elements and Southeast Asian cultural perspectives: collective values, Buddha&rsquo;s teaching, and social conservationism. Philosophically, it also discusses various social issues faced by people in the region, from scams and illegal prostitution to not enough attention given to global warming and political corruption.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the well-written plot, with many twists, the CGIs are well depicted throughout the series, while the technical explanation and illustrations proved to be quite impressive. Plus, there are also plenty of slapsticks to help you laugh.\r\n\r\nThe cast includes well-known names from Thailand, such as Pakorn Chatborrirak, Violette Wautier, Waruntorn Paonil, Treechada Hongsyok, Ray Macdonald, Timethai, Thongchai Thongkuntom, Aelm Thavornsiri, Pongsatorn Jongwilas, Chananticha Chaipa, and Wanichaya Pornpanarittichai. Everyone is provided a great performance based on a good script.\r\n\r\nWestern viewers may find it hard to understand Tomorrow and I, and that might have led to the moderate online reviews. However, if you happen to be a fan of motion pictures from Southeast Asia, this is the one you need to watch.', '173484567694668.jpg', '2024-12-21 13:08:15', 6, 3, 0),

Meanwhile, the $700 Razr gets a massive display upgrade, faster performance and a new suede-like finish on the outside. The phones are Moto&rsquo;s latest attempt at taking on Samsung in the fight for foldable dominance in the United States, and if you&rsquo;re going to buy a folding phone, chances are they&rsquo;ll pop up during your search.\r\n\r\nBut the question is: Are either of these Razrs worth the title of best foldable phone? Let&rsquo;s take a look.\r\n\r\nBoth of the new Razrs look a lot like their 2023 predecessors. They&rsquo;re roughly the same size and weight, and they have the same 6.9-inch folding displays. The difference is in the details: Motorola has tested both phones for IPX8 water resistance, which means you can dunk them in 1.5 meters of water for up to 30 minutes. Their hinges are also 30% stronger than before, and the crease in the middle of the screen is less pronounced (you can still see and feel it, but it&rsquo;s noticeably flatter this time around).\r\n\r\nInstead of all-glass exteriors, Moto is using both vegan leather and vegan suede for the new Razrs.

They agreed at the time that Lively and employees would no longer be shown nude videos or images of women, there would be no further mention of the pair&rsquo;s purported pornography addictions, &ldquo;no more descriptions of their own genitalia&rdquo; and no more disparaging comments would be made to Lively or her employees, per the complaint. They also agreed that an intimacy coordinator would be present at all times when Lively was on set in scenes with Baldoni.\r\n\r\nThe complaint also includes screen captures of text messages and correspondence, obtained by Lively&rsquo;s legal team in discovery, that they argue show orchestrated attempts on the part of Baldoni&rsquo;s PR representatives to hurt her reputation in the media as part of a &ldquo;social manipulation campaign.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;It Ends With Us&rdquo; is based on Colleen Hoover&rsquo;s hit 2016 novel of the same name and centers around domestic violence in a couple, which was portrayed on-screen by Lively and Baldoni.\r\n\r\nThe complaint, a precursor to a lawsuit, names Baldoni as a defendant, as well as his production company Wayfarer Studios, his publicist, Heath and a crisis public relations manager, among others.\r\n\r\nLively, also a producer on the film, &ldquo;seeks to set the record straight, to hold the Wayfarer Parties and Associates accountable, and to shine a light on this new form of retaliation so that it will not be used against any others who seek to stand up and speak out against sexual harassment,&rdquo; according to the complaint.\r\n\r\nBryan Freedman, an attorney for Baldoni, Heath and Wayfarer Studios, denied the allegations in a statement to CNN.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;These claims are completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media,&rdquo; Freedman said.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;It is shameful that Ms. Lively and her representatives would make such serious and categorically false accusations against Mr. Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and its representatives, as yet another desperate attempt to &lsquo;fix&rsquo; her negative reputation, which,&rdquo; Freedman added, &ldquo;was garnered from her own remarks and actions during the campaign for the film; interviews and press activities that were observed publicly, in real time and unedited, which allowed for the internet to generate their own views and opinions.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nWayfarer proactively hired a crisis PR manager, Freedman said, due to &ldquo;the multiple demands and threats&rdquo; made by Lively during production of the film, alleging she threatened &ldquo;not showing up to set&rdquo; and &ldquo;to not promote the film, ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met.&rdquo;', '1734847539Blake Lively.png', '2024-12-22 06:05:39', 9, 10, 0),
